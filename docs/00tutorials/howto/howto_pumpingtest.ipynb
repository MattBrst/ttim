    "We analyze pumping test data from a pumping test carried out near the *Oude Korendijk* in The Netherlands, as described in the famous book on pumping tests by Kruseman and de Ridder (downloadable [here](https://gw-project.org/download/analysis-and-evaluation-of-pumping-test-data/)). The pumping test was carried out in a 7 m thick, confined aquifer with the top at $z_t=-18$ m and the bottom at $z_b=-25$ m. The objective of the pumping test was to determine the hydraulic conductivity and specific storage coefficient of the aquifer.  The discharge of the well during the pumping test was 788 m$^3$/day. The observed drawdown (in meters) and the observation time (in minutes) after pumping started were measured in two observations wells, one located 30 m from the pumping well and the other located 90 m from the pumping well. Kruseman and de Ridder (1990) also report drawdown in an additional well, but that one is not considered here. "

The initial guess is that the hydraulic conductivity is $k=20$ m/d and the specific storage coefficient is $S_s=10^{-4}$ m$^{-1}$. `tmin` and `tmax` are set to cover all observation times. One well is added with a discharge of 788 m$^3$/d. No recovery was measured, so the well does not have to be shut off. Wellbore storage is not simulated. The model is solved. As a check, the head is plotted vs. the observations. This confirms that the model runs. As can be seen, the initial guess is not bad, but obviously not optimal. "

The thickness of the semi-confining layer is set to 1 (i.e., `z` goes from -17 to -18) and the initial guess for the resistance of the semi-confining layer is 1000 d. Storage in the semi-confining layer is negelected. A new calibration object is created, which is used now to fit three parameters. The additional parameter is called `'c0'`, which stands for the resistance of leaky layer 0, which is on top of aquifer layer 0.
